END TO END SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION USING ANN


PROPOSED SOLUTION



The proposed solution for the end-to-end speech emotion recognition using ML, ANN, and NLP consists of several stages, including preprocessing, feature extraction, feature fusion, and classification. Here's an outline of the model:

1.  Preprocessing:

Load the speech data and convert it into a suitable format. Perform noise reduction and normalization to improve the quality of the audio signal. Apply windowing and frame segmentation to divide the audio signal into overlapping frames.

2.	Feature Extraction:

●	Acoustic Features: Extract relevant acoustic features, such as MFCCs, pitch, and energy, which are known to be effective for emotion recognition.

●	Linguistic Features: Convert speech to text using speech recognition techniques (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text API). Then, apply NLP techniques like sentiment analysis (e.g., using TextBlob) to obtain sentiment polarity scores and other linguistic features.

3.	Feature Fusion:

Combine the extracted acoustic and linguistic features into a single feature vector, capturing complementary information from both sources.

4.  Classification:

Train an ANN model (e.g., a feed-forward neural network) using the fused feature vectors and corresponding emotion labels. Optimize the model by fine-tuning hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers, neurons, and learning rate.

5.  Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Analyse the results and compare them with existing approaches to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model.

6.  Post-processing (optional):

Implement a decision-making mechanism that considers both the ANN's output and the sentiment polarity to determine the final emotion label, potentially improving the overall performance.

The proposed solution aims to overcome the challenges associated with speech emotion recognition by integrating acoustic and linguistic features and leveraging the power of ANN for classification. By incorporating NLP techniques and feature fusion, the model has the potential to achieve high accuracy and robustness in recognizing emotions across various speakers and real-world conditions.
